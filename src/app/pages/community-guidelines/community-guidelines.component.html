    <app-expandable-card [title]="'Purpose and Values'">
      <p>
        Cruiz was created to empower individuals and communities through smart mobility. 
        By sharing cars rather than owning more vehicles, we can reduce congestion, 
        enhance accessibility and decrease the environmental footprint of transportation. 
        These guidelines help us build a trusted, inclusive and sustainable community that aligns 
        with Saudi Vision 2030's goals of smarter cities and economic diversification.

    <app-expandable-card [title]="'Respect and Lawfulness'">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Abide by the law: All users must obey local traffic laws and regulations. 
          Peer-to-peer car-sharing thrives when participants respect road rules and legal requirements. 
          Cruiz's partners emphasize innovation in cooperation with insurance providers and regulators 
          to support economic growth and Vision 2030.
        </li>
        <li>
          Treat others with respect: Discrimination, harassment, or abusive behaviour has no place on Cruiz. 
          We expect hosts and guests to communicate courteously and resolve issues in good faith. 
          Car-sharing is a community endeavour—mutual respect makes it work.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </app-expandable-card>
    <app-expandable-card [title]="'Trust and Accuracy'">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Provide honest listings: Hosts should accurately describe and photograph their vehicles so 
          guests know what they're booking. Cruiz lets guests filter by price, location and features; 
          clear listings help everyone find the right match.
        </li>
        <li>
          Maintain your vehicle: Hosts must keep their cars in safe, roadworthy condition. Because platforms 
          like Cruiz are designed to enable individuals to earn additional income, owners have a responsibility 
          to ensure vehicles meet safety standards.
        </li>
      </ul>

    </app-expandable-card>
    <app-expandable-card [title]="'Safety and Insurance'">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Comprehensive protection: Cruiz trips include comprehensive insurance. 
          Hosts and guests must not circumvent these policies. 
          Peer-to-peer car-sharing programs in Saudi Arabia offer customised insurance solutions 
          in partnership with insurers, so always verify that coverage is active before and during each trip.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Report incidents promptly: If an accident or mechanical issue occurs, 
          contact Cruiz support and the appropriate authorities immediately. 
          Prompt reporting allows us to assist quickly and ensure everyone's safety.
        </li>
      </ul>

    </app-expandable-card>
    <app-expandable-card [title]="'Responsibilities of Hosts'">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Prepare the car: Deliver the vehicle clean, fueled (or charged) and ready for use. 
          While Cruiz makes bookings quick and easy, hosts should make sure the car meets the description 
          and is fully functional.
        </li>
        <li>
          Verify eligibility: Ensure that the guest has a valid driver's licence and meets Cruiz's eligibility requirements. 
          Peer-to-peer car-sharing platforms rely on trust and proper verification.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be punctual: Honour agreed pickup and drop-off times. 
          Efficient scheduling helps maintain a seamless, multimodal transport system.
        </li>
        <li>
          No hidden listings: Only list vehicles that are not simultaneously advertised on other rental platforms. 
          Hosts must comply with Cruiz policies and local regulations when offering their cars.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </app-expandable-card>
    <app-expandable-card [title]="'Responsibilities of Guests'">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Respect the vehicle: Treat the car as if it were your own. Do not tamper with, misuse or neglect the vehicle. 
          Shared mobility helps reduce congestion and environmental impact—misuse undermines these benefits.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return on time: Bring the car back at the agreed time and location, with the same level of fuel or charge. 
          Timely returns help ensure efficient use of shared vehicles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep it clean: Remove personal belongings and trash before returning the car. 
          While normal dirt from weather and travel is expected, excessive mess may result in additional fees.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use authorized drivers only: Only the person who booked the car and has been verified by Cruiz may drive it. 
          Sharing the car with unauthorized drivers violates our policies and insurance agreements.
        </li>
      </ul>
