    <h2>Who Are We</h2>
    <p>
      We 'Cruiz' are built by and for Saudi communities. Cruiz platform is a disruptive 
      peer-to-peer car-sharing marketplace, offering car-rental services while aiming to change 
      the traditional car-rental experience in Saudi Arabia. Inspired by pioneering P2P platforms, we built 
      an app that lets people rent cars from their neighbors, skipping the rental counter and paperwork. 
      As we grow, we will continue to innovate and expand our network across Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. 
      The journey has just begun.

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      Cruiz will connect individuals willing to rent their vehicles with those who need convenient, 
      flexible, and budget-friendly rental solutions for cars, creating an opportunity for vehicle 
      owners to earn through their underutilized assets while giving the public a wide selection of 
      cars available for rent. We combine secure technology, instant booking and self-check-in to 
      make every trip effortless.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      Our platform will fuel the sharing economy to advance community-based car rentals forward, 
      thereby supporting the attainment of 2030 Vision goals on sustainability and economic diversification. 
      By offering a digital platform that makes car-sharing simple and trustworthy, we hope to lead the way 
      in building a smarter, more inclusive mobility landscape in the Gulf region.
