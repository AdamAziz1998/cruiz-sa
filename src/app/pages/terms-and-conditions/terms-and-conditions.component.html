          rentals completed in the previous month. The platform may delay the transfer in case of

          <b>Platform liability disclaimer:</b> The Cruiz platform is not a direct party to the contract
          between the renter and the lessor; it acts only as a broker to facilitate booking and
          payment. The platform assumes no direct responsibility for delays or damages caused by
          either party.

          <b>Deposit:</b> A refundable security deposit must be paid to the company's account to cover
          any violations or damages. This amount is retained in the company's account for two
          weeks after the rental period ends. Comprehensive insurance is mandatory on all rented
          vehicles to cover potential losses and protect the lessor from compensation claims if an
          accident occurs.
